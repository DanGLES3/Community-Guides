[ReVanced](https://revanced.app/) is a free modular patcher for Android apps such as YouTube. It can be used to create applications that have extra features and customizability, similar to how a browser extension works, but for an app.

ReVanced Extended is a derivative project of ReVanced mainly of just patches made for YouTube, YT Music, and Reddit.

### **5. Is revancedextended.com or revanced.io legitimate?**

No. All sites that distribute pre-patched / ready-to-use ReVanced Extended APKs are unofficial. If you signed-in to Google using an APK from revancedextended.com, revanced.io, or any similar site, we recommend that you change your password and remove any devices that are signed in.



### **6. Why can't I just download a pre-made APK instead of patching it myself?**

Due to legal reasons, ReVanced Extended cannot be directly distributed. Anyone distributing pre-patched ReVanced or ReVanced Extended APKs is not official and potentially untrustworthy.

### **7. What features are different between ReVanced Extended and ReVanced?**

The best way to answer this is by installing ReVanced Extended and comparing it to ReVanced. However, you can check what all of the patches do on [this page](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Patches-Documentation#patches-documentation). Or you can check what the all of the toggles in YouTube and YT Music Extended do on [this page](https://kazimmt.github.io/RVX-Features/). Alternateively, you can compare the list of patches between the [ReVanced Extended GitHub](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/tree/revanced-extended#readme) and the [ReVanced site](https://revanced.app/patches), but keep in mind that some patches can contain several features and options within, so just looking at the patches list doesn't tell the full story.



### **8. Can I have ReVanced Extended and ReVanced apps installed simultaneously?**

If you patch with the non-root method, YT ReVanced Extended and YTM Extended will have a unique package name and will not conflict with any apps. But under normal conditions, Reddit ReVanced Extended and Reddit ReVanced will conflict.



### **9. How do I update ReVanced Extended?**

Generally, you update by patching the currently suggested version of the app you want to patch and then install it on top of the existing ReVanced Extended app as an update. You can refer to the "Updating ReVanced Extended" section in the [YT ReVanced Extended community guide](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Community-Guides/blob/main/general-guides/community-wiki/yt-guide.md#updating-revanced-extended) or in the [YTM Extended community guide](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Community-Guides/blob/main/general-guides/community-wiki/ytm-guide.md#updating-revanced-extended) for in-depth info.
