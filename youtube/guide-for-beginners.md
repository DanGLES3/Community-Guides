# **1. Requirements:**

* Your device must be running Android 8.0+

* Your device must use the arm64-v8a architecture. You will be able to check what your device's architecture is at a later point in the tutorial. 

#### **Downloading MicroG, ReVanced Manager, and the YouTube APK...**

* Vanced MicroG `(latest version)`:

**Download and install the Vanced MicroG APK from [here](https://github.com/TeamVanced/VancedMicroG/releases/latest). Or you can download an updated forked version from [inotia00's GitHub](https://github.com/inotia00/VancedMicroG/releases/latest).**

* RVX Manager `(latest)`:

**Download and install the RVX Manager APK from the [RvX Manager GitHub page here](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-manager/releases/latest). The version linked here is the fork of the official Manager made by Inotia00 to be compatible with ReVanced Extended patches.**

* YouTube APK `(v18.25.40, nodpi)`:

**Download, BUT DO NOT INSTALL the YouTube `v18.25.40 (nodpi)` APK from [this link](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-18-25-40-release/youtube-18-25-40-android-apk-download/).**

# **2. Additional compatibility checks with the RVX Manager:**

* Making sure all necessary permissions are granted:

**Open the RVX Manager. Your device may open a settings page for choosing which apps of yours have permission to install unknown apps. Find the ReVanced Manager and give it the necessary permissions.**

* Now check to make sure your device is supported:

**Go to the ReVanced Manager settings and scroll to the bottom and make sure it says "Arch: arm64-v8a" is listed as shown in [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/gZbMyEL).** 

*(If it does not say "arm64-v8a", then you will need to stop the tutorial here and use a different method, device or patch on PC. Please refer to the [**documentation**](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-documentation) page.)*

*(You can find more info about what to do by reading the Requirements section in the [Wiki Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedextended/wiki/guide/#wiki_requirements).)*

# **3. Patching & Installing:**

After fully closing the Manager, open it again and go to Patcher > Select an application.

Press "**Storage**" [as shown in this image](https://imgur.com/a/vx64z3S).

Select the YouTube APK that you just downloaded from APKMirror from your downloads folder.

The application will be selected and the Default list of patches should also be selected automatically, you should have over 80 patches selected if that's the case.

* If you don't want to use the Default selection you **must** at least include the `MicroG Support` patch.

*This patch being excluded will almost surely result in playback issues, do not report issues without making sure it's included and enabled.*

When you are done selecting the patches press "**Done**" and then press "**Patch**".

Wait for the patching to be complete. It usually takes 2-5 minutes. Do not leave the app or it may cancel. Make sure no errors happen in this step.

#### Optional - Highly Recommended:

When patching is finished you can save the APK as a file so that you have it for later in case you have trouble installing it or want to share it. To do this, tap the three dots in the upper right corner of the screen and then press "Export APK" as shown in [this image](https://imgur.com/a/JqmfzAj).

Press "Install" and wait for it to finish installing. You may get a message saying that the installation was blocked because it is an unknown app. Tap "**More info**" and then "**Install anyway**" as shown [here](https://imgur.com/a/iLP2m7l).

‎[‎ ](LineBreak)

#### Optional - Link Association:

To have it so that when you click a YouTube link it opens it in the ReVanced Extended app instead of YouTube, go to the *App Info* of YT ReVanced Extended > Set as default > Open supported links, **On**. Then go back to the previous page. Tap "Supported web addresses" > turn them all **On**. You may also need to manually disable these settings for stock YouTube, or just disable/uninstall stock YouTube entirely. For MIUI users, use the Hidden Settings For MIUI app, and use its Manage Applications menu to do the same.

Alternatively there's an option in the Miscellaneous settings page inside the ReVanced Extended settings to take you straight to the link associations screen for RVX.
