### This thread is meant to concentrate all issues related to Buffering in a single place. Instead of making a new post, use this one.

### In the past week and a half we've had increasingly more reports about possible new Buffering Issues.

##### "Video stops and is buffering indefinitely after 00:10/00:59/01:10/01:40..."

##### "Videos stop loading after some and just buffer indefinitely..."

### Know that that's mostly a Known Issue, both in ReVanced and in Extended, yet, with an unknown fix as it stands if you're really being affected by it...

#### So far for some users the solution was simply a matter of getting the latest version of Patches, and use the **"Spoof player parameter"** and **"Spoof parameter type"** options in the "Settings → ReVanced Extended → Miscellaneous" settings page.

#### Many users reporting issues were just using old versions and those issues are mixed with the actual new issues people might be facing.

### I ask that when reporting issues please provide the minimum relevant information below after reading and trying the [item #4 in the Troubleshooting page of the Wiki](https://reddit.com/r/revancedextended/wiki/yt-troubleshooting):

#### → ReVanced Extended **YouTube/Music application version**:

#### → Version of the **rvx-patches** applied:

#### → **Patching Tool used** and **version** of said tool:

##### Please check in the "Patches information" menu in the "Miscellaneous" settings page mentioned before for this information.
